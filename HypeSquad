## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
The name of the proejct is not descriptive.
- A brief description of your project.
We are building the first polish DAO community around blockchain and Web3 technology on various social media channels - Twitch, Discord, Twitter, etc. The main idea is to bring blockchain closer to the people, and at the beginning, members will not know that they are using blockchain to form, vote, and decide about the community's future. So the first part is to make the community use blockchain technology without knowing it's some new technology.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
In Poland, there are a lot of people who want to enter the web3 world but the knowledge is really hard to find and we need more educational materials right now.
The main goal is education around: knowledge, career, business development, and investment. The project is set up for the long term, and we are presenting a plan for first 12 months.
Benefits:
Educated people ready to start work in web3 (developers, business managers, marketing, HR, PR, UX/UI etc.)
Businessmen will have interesting opportunities and enter their existing business from web2 to web3
New projects and initiatives in web3 because people will understand the idea and possibilities
People start investing in web3 startups, tokens, NFT, Gamefi, DeFi, metaverse, new technology
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
I have a vision, I know what I want to build, I'm in web3 full time for over 3 years and I have experience and know-how on how to do it. We want to creat value in Poland and education to bring more opole on and show them long term proejcts and vision for web3.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
High quality educational contant:
Lectures in the top 100 high schools in Warsaw - this will be the beginning of the project 100 lectures will be given in Q1-Q2 2023 and it will be the main boost at the start for community building.
Full DAO organization set up - our project will be DAO organization. After educating people what DAO is the how it will work, we will set up two layer DAO organization in NaaS
First community investment in the web3 project - we want to make it easier for the community to start investing in web3 so we create a social investing hub.
Web3 talent acquisition server - after educating people about web3 we will release services for employers and employees.
Community launchpad - everyone in DAO will be allowed to use our launchpad, where the community can help in brand new community projects.

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y9c_UJsZOiqb6svSbYN5spvf-Kl1c1rRQamBmAifDaw/edit?usp=sharing
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
